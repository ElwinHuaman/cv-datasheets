# *Basaa* &mdash; Basaa (`bas`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset for Basaa (`bas`).

## Language

Basaa is a language spoken in Cameroon by a population of around 500k speakers. While the vitality of Basaa is considered to be stable by [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bas/) intergenerational transmission is not systematically achieved, mostly in urban areas.

#### User defined

### Gender

Self-declared gender information, frequency refers to the number of clips annotated with this gender.

## Text corpus

### Writing system

Basaa has several competing writing norms. The most widely used are the Catholic missionary orthography, the Prostestant missionary orthography, and a version of the General Alphabet of Cameroonian Languages that was adapted to Basaa. 

This dataset is mostly based on the Protestant missionary's orthography, with minor alterations concerning, for example, the signaling of *b* as implosive [ɓ]. For example, *m'bôñ* "cassava" vs *mbôñ* "poison". Other alterations includes the signaling of the *n-* prefix followed by the *y* symbol, to distinguish it from the complex symbol *ny*. For example, *nyo* "mouth" vs *a n'yo* "he stole palm wine from the palm trunk". 

Some of these alterations were introduced at a later stage of the elaboration of the dataset, which explains the lack of orthographic consistency throughout the prompts, as well as the transcriptions of spontaneous speech.

### Recommended post-processing

We recommend that you run Unicode normalisation over the transcripts.
