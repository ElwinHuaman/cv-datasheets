# *Basaa* &mdash; Basaa (`bas`)

## Language

Basaa is a language spoken in Cameroon by a population of around 500k speakers. While the vitality of Basaa is considered to be stable by [ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bas/) intergenerational transmission is not systematically achieved, mostly in urban areas.

Even though Basaa is represented by the unique code `bas`, in reality, there ought to be more derivative codes that index particular dialects, as mutual understanding and mutual acceptability from one region to another is hard to measure and predict.

### Variants
The number of known varieties of Basaa is not exhaustive and depends much on the perspective for representing the geography of the language. Some of the most commonly cited varieties are : *Basaa ba Ño-Nloñ*, also called *Mbene*, *Babimbi* (*Babimbi* is further sub-divided into *Babimbi 1*, *Babimbi*, *Babimbi 3*), *Basaa Ba Duala*, *Basaa Ba Yabasi*, *Lôngas*, *Donga*.

### Orthography
Basaa has several competing writing norms. The most widely used are the Catholic missionary orthography, the Prostestant missionary orthography, and a version of the General Alphabet of Cameroonian Languages that was adapted to Basaa. This dataset is mostly based on the Protestant missionary's orthography, with minor alterations concerning, for example, the signaling of `b` as implosive `ɓ`. For example, `m'bôñ` *cassava* vs `mbôñ` *poison*. Other alterations includes the signaling of the `n` prefix followed by the `y` symbol, to distinguish it from the complex symbol `ny`. For example, `nyo` *mouth* vs `a n'yo` *he stole palm wine from the paml trunk*. Some of these alterations were introduced at a later stage of the elaboration of the dataset, which explains the lack of orthographic consistency throughout the prompts, as well as the transcriptions of spontaneous speech.

### Accents
