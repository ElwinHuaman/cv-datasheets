# Mozilla Common Voice: CV (cv)

This datasheet is for the Mozilla Common Voice (MCV) dataset for Chuvash (cv),
version `22.0-2025-06-25`.

## Language

Chuvash is a Turkic language spoken primarily in the Chuvash Republic and
adjacent areas in European Russia. It is the sole surviving member of the Oghur
branch of the Turkic language family. While most other Turkic languages (like
Turkish and Uzbek) belong to the Common Turkic branch, Chuvash stands apart,
showing significant divergence. It is spoken by approximately 1 million people
and is co-official in the Chuvash Republic alongside Russian.

## Fun Fact

Chuvash is the only living language from the Oghur branch of the Turkic
language family. Its closest relatives, such as Bulgar (the language of the
Volga Bulgars) and Khazar, are now extinct. This makes it linguistically
unique among all other modern Turkic languages.
